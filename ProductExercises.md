The following are exercises for product positions.

## **Title:** **Product Roadmap/Positioning - New/CRL Specific (incl. Take-home exercise work)**

- **Overview:** In this interview, you will be getting a sense of how well the candidate understands the basic aspects of product management and how passionate they are about the discipline. 

- **Follow-up Questions:** What’s your favorite B2B product and why?


## **Title: Product Roadmap/Positioning - Work Exp - Tech**

- **Overview:** In this interview, you are assessing if the candidate has the ability to work well with a Cockroach Labs engineering team to define, communicate, and deliver on a feature roadmap. At this level, candidates may focus on the smaller picture, so the emphasis is placed on the ability to execute against a roadmap, influence and collaborate with internal/external technical stakeholders, and make principled tradeoffs in order to deal with technical or market realities.

- **Setup:** Candidate will be asked by the recruiter to pick a product (or feature) that they took through to launching to the public. The preference is that they use a product that had technology clients (as opposed to marketing or another department). They will be prepared to discuss the product (or feature) with you.

- **Part 1:** Work Experience - Ask them to dive into their product/feature from a technical standpoint. They should be able to speak to the technical details in this section. How did the product evolve? From concept to launch or was it pre-existing? 


## **Title:** **Analytical Case**

- **Overview:** Provide the candidate with this  [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12f3kjlTs5QpCmsvXo-ZLOWG5rFdc4DaB6TwJxoQxVOE/edit#gid=0) and have them pull insights. 

- **Part 1:** Expectations are for candiate to show new cluster growth and create cluster segments via pivot tables. 

- **Part 2:** [Provide charts](https://docs.google.com/a/cockroachlabs.com/spreadsheets/d/1U49nuhoz4wL3mThxLrIEiXcchObMK-VI3QZX6vbgZ-s/edit?zx=we6r4gilfygy&usp=docs_web). What are the takeaways? Here’s a chart that shows groups of clusters that joined in a given month and what % of those groups were still around 1, 2, 3 etc months later.  What are some of the things that look like their going well? What are some areas you would be concerned about?

## **Title:** **Understanding your Customers**

- **Overview:** In this interview, you are focusing on the candidate’s ability to understand customers in an enterprise environment where we may not have a lot of data. Product Managers have to know (and have to have frequent contact and communication with) their customers and users. Successful PMs should incorporate real world customer needs and feedback into product development.  

- **Part 1: Work Experience:** What are some of the ways you’ve gotten to know your customers in the past?

- **Part 2: Cockroach Labs**

- **Follow-up Questions:** 

    - Who do you think our users are? Can you describe a few segments? (could be operator vs dev vs DBA or startup, midmarket, enterprise, for example)

    - How do you think the differences in those segments impacts their needs from the product? How would you validate this?

    - How would you approach learning about enterprise users vs core users?
   
## **Title:** **Whiteboarding Customer Experience**

- **Overview:** In this interview, you are focusing on the candidate’s ability to understand customer pain points in an enterprise environment and collaborate with design + engineering to create solutions they love. Product Managers have to know (and have frequent contact and communication with) their customers and users. Successful PMs should incorporate real world customer needs and feedback into product development and go beyond the UI when thinking about user experience.

- **Exercise:** We have a new product design prototyping tool that designers use to share mocks with other stakeholders. We need a way to onboard new users. The goal is to provide user stories or user flows that outline this process. 

- **Interview Flow** 
    1. Context/Discovery - there is a SaaS product for collaborating with design - 5 minutes
    
    2. Framing: Goals/Audience - what are you optimizing for and for whom? - 5 minutes
    
    3. Tactical execution - what is the actual flow or user stories - 30 minutes

    4. Edge cases - 10 mins

    5. Validation - How can you validate that your solution meets the goals we mentioned earlier? - 10 mins
