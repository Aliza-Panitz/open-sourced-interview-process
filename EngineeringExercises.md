## Coding Interviews

Coding interviews give the interviewer insight into your the following areas:

* Coding and debugging

* Algorithms

* Data Structures

* Code Structure

* Design

All of our coding questions are technical concepts that our engineers focus on within their roles. While we don’t dive into the specifics of our coding questions, we encourage you to refresh core technical concepts. For all coding interviews, we recommend using a language that you are extremely familiar with, rather than one that is new to you, like Go. 

### Take-home Exercise

As initial steps in the engineering interview process, you will be sent a unique CoderPad link (a web-based code editor/build environment) that contains the coding question as well as tips, and some test cases to get you started. The exercise typically takes about ~1 hour to code and ~1 hour to debug and polish. The intent behind the take-home exercise is to make it as close to an on-the-job simulation as possible, working on your own tools if you wish, on your own schedule, to create a familiar environment in which you can do your best work.

Once you have completed the question, you will submit the link via our applicant tracking system for a member of our engineering team to review. They’ll be looking at correctness, the completeness of your test cases, and the overall structure, cleanliness and readability of your solution.

If the submitted solution looks good to the reviewer, we schedule a Google Hangout with the reviewer where you’ll revisit your code, again in a CoderPad session.  We’ll ask you to extend the problem with additional or changed functionality by modifying your previously submitted code. We think this is more representative of what we do most in our day to day work: modify *existing* code to add new features or handle changing product requirements, as opposed to starting from scratch every day.

### Onsite Coding Interviews

For onsite coding interviews, we will ask you to do a live coding exercise, either in CoderPad or in you own development environment if you prefer to bring your own computer.  Before diving in, we recommend you take a moment and repeat the question back to the interviewer to make sure that you understand the question. For some problems, it can help to jot down your design or the flow of your solution on the provided paper before getting started with the code. 

If you get stuck, our interviewer will provide clarity or hints to help you get unblocked. Always think out loud and let us know what you’re working on or what you’re having trouble with. This not only invites the interviewer into your thought process but can help lead you toward the right path if things have gone astray.

## Design Interviews

Systems design interviews are important because they give us insight into how you think about scale. We expect you know the fundamentals of a system and can logically think through how to build one. This interview is a discussion between you and the interviewer, leveraging the whiteboard. 

### "Choose Your Own" Design

All of our interview questions up until now have focused on a known problem that we are experts on here at Cockroach Labs. This question flips that script. Instead of the interviewer being the expert, the interviewer will be the student, asking the interviewee for an in-depth explanation of a design or project that they’ve worked on in the past. 

You are informed about the question beforehand and you are expected to be able to  discuss the design of your choosing on a deep technical level. You should make sure to pick a topic that you consider yourself to be an expert on. 

### Role-related System Design 

This question varies based off on the position you are applying for. For example, if you are applying to the Full Stack role, you will have a different question from what engineers are asked if they are applying to the Backend role. 

While we do not disclose details of this question, we ask for engineers to think about large-scale system design and architectures that may be relevant for their position if you worked at Cockroach Labs.
