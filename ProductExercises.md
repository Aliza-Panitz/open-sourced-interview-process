**Title of the Exercise: Product Roadmap/Positioning - Work Exp - Tec**

- **Overview:** In this interview, you are assessing if the candidate has the ability to work well with a Cockroach Labs engineering team to define, communicate, and deliver on a feature roadmap. At this level, candidates may focus on the smaller picture, so the emphasis is placed on the ability to execute against a roadmap, influence and collaborate with internal/external technical stakeholders, and make principled tradeoffs in order to deal with technical or market realities.

- **Setup:** Candidate will be asked by the recruiter to pick a product (or feature) that they took through to launching to the public. The preference is that they use a product that had technology clients (as opposed to marketing or another department). They will be prepared to discuss the product (or feature) with you.

- **Part 1:** Work Experience - Ask them to dive into their product/feature from a technical standpoint. They should be able to speak to the technical details in this section. How did the product evolve? From concept to launch or was it pre-existing?

**Title of the Exercise:** **Analytical Case**

- **Overview:** Provide the candidate with this  [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12f3kjlTs5QpCmsvXo-ZLOWG5rFdc4DaB6TwJxoQxVOE/edit#gid=0) and have them pull insights. 

- **Part 1:** From the attached sheet the candidate should, at the minimum, be able to show new cluster growth and create cluster segments via pivot tables. From this data you can also calculate monthly active clusters and cohort retention, but that’s not a requirement to actually get to. 

- **Part 2:** [Provide charts](https://docs.google.com/a/cockroachlabs.com/spreadsheets/d/1U49nuhoz4wL3mThxLrIEiXcchObMK-VI3QZX6vbgZ-s/edit?zx=we6r4gilfygy&usp=docs_web). What are the takeaways? Here’s a chart that shows groups of clusters that joined in a given month and what % of those groups were still around 1, 2, 3 etc months later.  What are some of the things that look like their going well? What are some areas you would be concerned about?

**Title of the Exercise:** **Understanding your Customers**

1 **Overview:** In this interview, you are focusing on the candidate’s ability to understand customers in an enterprise environment where we may not have a lot of data.

Successful PMs should incorporate real world customer needs and feedback into product development.

What are some of the ways you’ve gotten to know your customers in the past?

3 **Part 2: Cockroach Labs**

4 **Follow-up Questions:** 

- Who do you think our users are? Can you describe a few segments? (could be operator vs dev vs DBA or startup, midmarket, enterprise, for example)

- How do you think the differences in those segments impacts their needs from the product? How would you validate this?

- How would you approach learning about enterprise users vs core users?
