### Rejecting Applicants

1. At any time during the interview process, the candidate can be rejected by the company or withdraw themselves from the process.

2. The applicant will be notified by the recruiter within 3 days of the last interview stage to share our hiring decision and explain the next steps in the interview process.  If the candidate asks for further feedback, it will always be related to the job requirements. We encourage candidates to use this feedback to see where they may still have room to grow. 

3. It is important to remember that Cockroach Labs is still a small company, so the requirements are specific and there are high expectations for every role. We want to make sure that everyone we hire is successful in their role, and if we feel there is any misalignment with the role, we would rather not move the candidate forward at that time.

4. The recruiter will send out a feedback survey to all candidates within 2 days of their onsite interview. The Recruiting Team will review all feedback and use it to improve the hiring process.
