As such, this role involves overseeing the design and execution of all digital, print, display, and collateral content.  Being at a young B2B company, you will have to make smart decisions in a fast-moving creative environment. Given that CockroachDB is a highly technical product in a highly technical industry, we target two personas: developers and IT decision-makers (such as Chief Architects and CIOs).

Make sure to leverage the Cockroach Labs style guide to ensure brand consistency.

    Once onsite, you should be prepared to discuss your creative process, what you hoped to achieve with your work, and how you went about accomplishing that goal. More generally, think about how you take designs from concept to reality and how you collaborate with others throughout the creative process to achieve success.

Let’s say, hypothetically, that you came up with the perfect story and are ready to start producing content in the context of this positioning.
