## Your First Weeks at Cockroach Labs

During your Month Of Learning Things (MOLT), you will transform from a new Roacher to a Roacher making impact day to day! This mirrors the process for actual cockroaches where baby cockroaches (nymphs) go through a molting process to shed their skin, create a hard outer shell and become an adult cockroach.

## Onboarding at Cockroach Labs

On Week 1, we start off understanding how we operate at Cockroach Labs and why this opportunity to build a database is special. Over the course of the week, we begin to understand a bit more about CockroachDB. If you’re unfamiliar with what a database is, we’ll start you off there, but if you’ve worked with databases before, we’ll share a deep dive into how ours works.

On your second and fourth weeks, we give you an introduction to how other teams work at Cockroach Labs. The goal is to give you insight into what other teams work and how we all contribute to our company mission. It’s a way to highlight work and roles that you may be unfamiliar with but also share ways that you can collaborate and support those departments.

We onboard new hires every 2 weeks to keep a consistent onboarding cycle and to have new hires join with others. We know that ramping up at a new company takes time, so we encourage you to use your first month to learn, digest, and ask questions.
