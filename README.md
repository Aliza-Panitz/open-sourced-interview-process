## Welcome to the Cockroach Labs Interview Process
You’ve heard it before folks. The interview process is broken. So what are we doing to fix it? At Cockroach Labs, we are exploring new ways to structure our interview process to account for bias and build an inclusive culture. Instead of asking questions based on past performance or hypothetical future situations, we focus on assessing the skills you’ll use in your role with exercise based interviews. 

**Why are we open sourcing the interview process?**

- **To help candidates feel prepared:** If you spend the time to research Cockroach Labs and our interview process, we will be thrilled.  We think that if candidates spend the time to prepare for engaging discussions with the team, they will be ready to do the same when they join the team! 

- **To usher in a new standard of interviewing and transparency:** We want to encourage founders, recruiters, and everyone involved in the hiring process to think outside the box regarding the interview process.  We want candidates to get a realistic preview of what’s to come in their role at Cockroach Labs by setting up relevant simulations and scenarios. We are always asking ourselves, “what else can we be doing to provide candidates with a process that is fair and inclusive?”


- **To collaborate.** Let’s challenge our bias *together*. Let’s all pledge to do better than we have before. We welcome feedback on our interview process and encourage anyone reading this to contribute your ideas to our process as well!

## Getting Started

The following content will provide both candidates and recruiters with valuable information. 

**For candidates:**

- You will leave with a thorough understanding of the interview process at Cockroach Labs, along with visibility into real questions from our onsite interviews. Our recruiters will be happy to confirm which of these questions will be presented during the onsite interview. 

- Please note, around 10% of each interview is spent on a curve-ball question that we do not include in the exercises below. While you can come prepared for a majority of the interview, we also like to see how you think on your feet.

**For recruiters:**

- Leverage the Cockroach Labs interview process and questions for your company’s hiring process. If you would like access to the curveball questions, please reach out direct to recruiting@cockroachlabs.com, and we will be happy to share them with you.

- Contributions to the Cockroach Labs Interview Process are welcomed and encouraged! Please see Contributing to the Interview Process Guide below. 

## Interview Process and Timeline

#### Overview

![](images/HiringProcess.png)

We aim to have our interview process take an average of 3 weeks from start to finish.  Between each step of the interview process, we ask for at most 3 business days for us to to make a decision. While we would love to know whether you'd like to accept an offer from us in 3 days as well, we are happy to extend offer deadlines up to one month, so that you can make the best decision for you and your family.

Remember that at any point during the interview process, you can reach out to us for updates on your candidacy.

1. **Candidate Application:** Applicants receive an automated message from the Applicant Tracking System (in this case, [Greenhouse](https://www.greenhouse.io)) to confirm receipt of their application. The note thanks them for submitting their information and contains a Cockroach Labs Company Guide that gives applicants an inside look into the company culture.

2. **Candidate Application Review:** The recruiter for the position will do the first round of evaluations and review application submissions. If more information is required, a member of the team will reach out to the applicant directly. Candidates that are disqualified at this stage will be notified by the recruiter.

3. **Recruiter Phone Screen:** If the candidate qualifies, the recruiter will send a confirmation for a 30-minute call to explore the candidate’s background and experience. Depending on the outcome of the screening call, the recruiter will either reject the candidate or move them to the next stage in the process. The candidate will either proceed to a take-home exercise or a technical phone interview. Please note, the candidate’s resume and the recruiter’s notes from the pre-screen are not shared with the hiring team. Learn more about this here: "[How We're Fighting Unconscious Bias](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/fighting-unconscious-bias-cockroach-labs/)."

4. **Phone Interview and/or Take-home Exercise**

    - **Phone interview:** The 1-hour phone interview with a member from the team covering skills related to the role. For technical phone interviews, we use Google Hangouts and [coderpad.io](http://coderpad.io/), covering coding, data structures, and algorithms.

    - **Take-home Exercise:** Typically taking 1-2 hours to complete, the take-home exercise allows for the hiring manager to review a candidate’s demonstration of skills directly related to the position before proceeding to the onsite interview. The take-home exercise replaces one phone interview and one onsite interview, equaling two hours of engagement.  

5. **In-person interviews:** Next steps in the process are an onsite interviews. The onsite interview team consists of members from the company that a candidate will work with. We limit the onsite interview to 4-5 exercise based interviews and 1 lunch. The interviews could include people on the direct team or cross teams. The lunch is time for a candidate to relax and ask questions to learn more about Cockroach Labs and get a feel for our culture. The recruiter will share an overview of who the candidate will be meeting before the onsite interview. 

6. **Hiring Committee Review:** After the onsite interview is complete, feedback from the interview process is shared across the interview team, including the candidate’s resume and recruiter’s prescreen notes. Interview team members review the feedback and independently reach a decision of hire/no-hire based on the comprehensive feedback before the HC Review. At the HC review, the interview team reaches a consensus on whether to proceed with or reject the candidate.  

7. **Reference calls:** The staffing team will make reference calls for promising candidates. At a minimum, two reference calls should be completed - preferring at least one to be a manager or someone who has worked directly with the candidate and can speak to their work. 

8. **Final Review:** After reference calls are completed successfully, the recruiter submits the employee packet to the CEO and Hiring Manager for approval.

9. **Offer Extend:** The recruiter will reach out to schedule time to connect with the candidate to extend the candidate the offer. Initially, this is done verbally but is always followed by the written offer as described in the section on preparing offers. The Hiring Manager and interview team follows-up to answer any questions that the candidate may have, which will hopefully lead to the candidate accepting the offer. 

10. **Offer Accept/Onboarding:** If the candidate accepts the offer, the onboarding process begins.

## Challenging our Unconscious Bias

In the effort of building a diverse workforce, at Cockroach Labs, we ask the question "are we missing strong candidates because of preconceptions or unconscious biases of the interviewer?" To challenge our bias, we have taken two actions:

1. Exercise based interviewing

2. Removing resumes

Our hypothesis is that a structured and fair process means better decisions. Eliminating all bias or complete anonymity is not the goal. 

## Exercise Based Interview Questions

The purpose of an interview is to obtain information about a candidate in order to predict future performance. To accomplish this, we rely on Exercise-Based Interviewing. Exercise based interviews can include case studies, group exercises involving role play or discussions, individual exercises, or presentations. They allow for our interviewers to witness the direct application of a candidate’s abilities to competencies required for the role. Rather than guess if a candidate can do the job based on their answers to behavioral questions, we ask for candidates to show. During the interview, candidates are asked to complete exercises that are similar to the initiatives they would complete when actually working in the position on a day to day basis.

For engineering positions, we use coding and system design questions. For non-tech, we use job-based simulations in the form of case studies, individual exercises, and/or presentations. We are not currently open sourcing our technical interview questions, however, the following are some examples of what to expect when going through the interview process with Cockroach Labs:

1. Median Data Structure: Develop a data structure that is better than this "brute force" median computation. The data structure needs to support insert, delete and retrieval of the median.

2. Regex engine: Implement a subset of regex matching

3. Minimum snippet window: Given K sets of integers, find the minimum interval containing one from each set
